# Maria Ma, MPH
Placeholder for a portfolio page

Hi, I'm Maria Ma. I got my MPH from the [UC Berkeley School of Public Health](http://sph.berkeley.edu/), with a focus in [Infectious Disease and Vaccinology](http://microbe.berkeley.edu). My undergraduate degree was in [Microbiology](http://microbiology.ucdavis.edu).

My interests are, broadly, in improving healthcare. I'm interested in impact evaluation, improving quality of care, and cost effectiveness. My more academic interests are in disease modeling, outbreak predictions, and combatting antimicrobial resistance. I'm also interested in setting foot in the health technology innovation space. 

This page is intended as a space where I can showcase what I am learning about data visualizations among other things.

I am based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and am currently looking for work. 

In my past life, I was a synthetic biologist working on filamentous fungi and yeast, [making](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2016062857A1?cl=pt) [enzymes](http://www.google.com.pg/patents/WO2016062855A1?cl=en).

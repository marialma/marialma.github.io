Hi, I'm Maria Ma. I got my MPH from the [UC Berkeley School of Public Health](http://sph.berkeley.edu/), with a focus in [Infectious Disease and Vaccinology](http://microbe.berkeley.edu). My undergraduate degree was in [Microbiology](http://microbiology.ucdavis.edu).

In my past life, I was a synthetic biologist working on filamentous fungi and yeast, [making](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2016062857A1?cl=pt) [enzymes](http://www.google.com.pg/patents/WO2016062855A1?cl=en).

I am based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and am currently [working for a digital global health nonprofit](http://medicmobile.org) as an Impact Specialist/Analyst. Email me at i.am.maria.ma at gmail.

### Interests
My interests can be broadly described as fighting three of the four horsemen of the apocalypse - disease, war, and famine. I'm interested in impact evaluation, improving quality of care, and cost effectiveness, as well as using health technology to augment these goals. My more academic interests are in disease modeling/outbreak predictions, conflict mapping, and combatting antimicrobial resistance. 

### Projects 
This page is intended as a space where I can showcase what I am learning about data visualizations among other things. Most of my code these days is written for work. 

Among the projects I have squirreled away here are:

* [My comprehensive Masters paper](https://github.com/marialma/Capstone-Paper)
* [Hospital closures and rural access project](https://github.com/marialma/small-things/tree/master/urgent_care_project) - [Write up here](https://medium.com/@maria.ma/urgent-care-access-in-the-united-states-rural-hospital-closures-8a68c4ae612) - A project using Python and R to look at access to emergency care across the US
* [An interactive simple model](https://marialma.shinyapps.io/shinyflu/) - A supplement to this [write up](https://medium.com/@maria.ma/always-get-your-flu-shot-9333df389fe2), about why you should get your flu vaccination.
* [Tidy Tuesday Submissions](https://github.com/marialma/TidyTuesday)  - occasional explorations for [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) 
* [An ongoing effort to better understand the 2017 Cholera epidemic in Yemen](https://github.com/marialma/2017-Cholera-in-Yemen) - [Write up here](https://medium.com/@maria.ma/progression-of-the-ongoing-cholera-outbreak-in-yemen-4d370b38afac) - A project using R to clean up and visualize data related to the ongoing cholera epidemic in Yemen.

I'm compiling a list of robust, publically available data sources. You can find that [here](https://marialma.github.io/Public-Data-Sets/). 

### Where else to find me

I run a [weekly newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/guacamolebio) on public health and global development. Check out my [archives](https://tinyletter.com/guacamolebio/archive)! *On Hiatus*

I run a bimonthly global/public health meetup in the SF Bay Area. Email me to find out more!

My [LinkedIn is here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marialma/).

My [Medium account is here](https://medium.com/@maria.ma), where I try to write things for public health. My intended audience is both public health people and the general public. 

My [Tableau Public account is here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.ma5849#!), where you can browse some of the other things I've worked on. 

My [Twitter feed is here](https://twitter.com/guacamolebio), where I save links to things I enjoyed reading, and talk about healthcare/health systems, infectious disease, global issues, and small amounts of economics. Apologies in advance for the occasional political post; it is difficult to separate politics from healthcare in this time.

Hi, I'm Maria Ma. I got my MPH from the [UC Berkeley School of Public Health](http://sph.berkeley.edu/), with a focus in [Infectious Disease and Vaccinology](http://microbe.berkeley.edu). My undergraduate degree was in [Microbiology](http://microbiology.ucdavis.edu).

In my past life, I was a synthetic biologist working on filamentous fungi and yeast, [making](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2016062857A1?cl=pt) [enzymes](http://www.google.com.pg/patents/WO2016062855A1?cl=en).

I am based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and am currently looking for work. Email me at maria.ma at berkeley.edu.

### Interests
My interests can be broadly described as fighting three of the four horsemen of the apocalypse - disease, war, and famine. I'm interested in impact evaluation, improving quality of care, and cost effectiveness, as well as using health technology to augment these goals. My more academic interests are in disease modeling, outbreak predictions, and combating antimicrobial resistance. 

### Projects 
This page is intended as a space where I can showcase what I am learning about data visualizations among other things. 

Among the projects I have squirreled away here are:

These things are mostly finished:
* [My comprehensive Masters paper](https://github.com/marialma/Capstone-Paper)
* [An interactive simple model to understand disease dynamics](https://marialma.shinyapps.io/shinyflu/) 
* [Tidy Tuesday Submissions](https://github.com/marialma/TidyTuesday) - I participate in [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md), a weekly data project.

These are things I have a lot of interest in and are still working on:
* [Hospital closures and rural access project](https://github.com/marialma/small-things/tree/master/urgent_care_project)
* [An ongoing effort to better understand the 2017 Cholera epidemic in Yemen](https://github.com/marialma/2017-Cholera-in-Yemen) 
* [Poking around the 2017 US Hepatitis A outbreak](https://github.com/marialma/2017-Santa-Cruz-HAV-Modeling) 
* [Looking at gonorrhea trends in Santa Cruz](https://github.com/marialma/Santa_Cruz_CGSS) 

Most of these projects are very much still in progress, and I work on them when I can.

I'm compiling a list of robust, publically available data sources. You can find that [here](https://marialma.github.io/Public-Data-Sets/). 

### Where else to find me

My [LinkedIn is here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marialma/).

My [Medium account is here](https://medium.com/@maria.ma), where I try to write things for public health. My intended audience is both public health people and the general public. 

My [Tableau Public account is here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.ma5849#!), where you can browse some of the other things I've worked on. 

My [Twitter feed is here](https://twitter.com/guacamolebio), where I save links to things I enjoyed reading, and talk about healthcare/health systems, infectious disease, global issues, and small amounts of economics. Apologies in advance for the occasional political post; it is difficult to separate politics from healthcare in this time.

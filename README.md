Hi, I'm Maria Ma. I got my MPH from the [UC Berkeley School of Public Health](http://sph.berkeley.edu/), with a focus in [Infectious Disease and Vaccinology](http://microbe.berkeley.edu). I took a bunch of classes in the [Epidemiology department](https://grad.berkeley.edu/program/epidemiology/). My undergraduate degree was in [Microbiology](http://microbiology.ucdavis.edu).

In my past life, I was a synthetic biologist working on filamentous fungi and yeast, [making](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2016062857A1?cl=pt) [enzymes](http://www.google.com.pg/patents/WO2016062855A1?cl=en).

I am based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and am currently [working for a digital global health nonprofit](http://medicmobile.org) as an Impact Specialist/Analyst. Email me at i.am.maria.ma at gmail.

## What I'm Good At
The thing I'm best at is designing elegant studies, using both observational data and setting up data collection. This mostly means I'm great at thinking about *causal inference*. 
I'm also pretty good at *R (tidyverse and ggplot)*, and *data visualization*. I approach all of my work with failure mode analysis always in the back of my head. Healthcare is my domain; I see it as my duty to make sure we don't harm people. 

I speak conversational Mandarin Chinese, I understand Shanghainese, and I'm slowly learning Swahili and French. 

### Interests
My interests can be broadly described as fighting three of the four horsemen of the apocalypse - disease, war, and famine. I'm interested in improving quality of care, and I believe in the promise of technology to achieve this. I think geospatial + satellite data is currently the only place where we can truly do global health data science. My more academic interests are in disease modeling/outbreak predictions, conflict mapping, and combatting antimicrobial resistance. 

### Projects 
This page is intended as a space where I can showcase what I am learning about data visualizations among other things. Most of my code these days is written for work. 

Among the projects I have squirreled away here are:

* [My comprehensive Masters paper](https://github.com/marialma/Capstone-Paper)
* [Hospital closures and rural access project](https://github.com/marialma/small-things/tree/master/urgent_care_project) - [Write up here](https://medium.com/@maria.ma/urgent-care-access-in-the-united-states-rural-hospital-closures-8a68c4ae612) - A project using Python and R to look at access to emergency care across the US
* [An interactive simple model](https://marialma.shinyapps.io/shinyflu/) - A supplement to this [write up](https://medium.com/@maria.ma/always-get-your-flu-shot-9333df389fe2), about why you should get your flu vaccination.
* [Tidy Tuesday Submissions](https://github.com/marialma/TidyTuesday)  - occasional explorations for [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) 
* [An ongoing effort to better understand the 2017 Cholera epidemic in Yemen](https://github.com/marialma/2017-Cholera-in-Yemen) - [Write up here](https://medium.com/@maria.ma/progression-of-the-ongoing-cholera-outbreak-in-yemen-4d370b38afac) - A project using R to clean up and visualize data related to the ongoing cholera epidemic in Yemen.

I'm compiling a list of robust, publically available data sources. You can find that [here](https://marialma.github.io/Public-Data-Sets/).
